# MBiol Molecular Cell Biology Project

*Natasha L. Hopkins 22/23*

-   This is an RProj, which means that all the files required to run the code are contained in one folder

-   Go to 'open project' and open the 'RProject' file to open the files

-   R files are stored in the 'r' folder

    -   Results files are numbered in the order of my report figures
    -   Run '01_packages' file first

-   About the files:

    -   '*H3*' may be used as shorthand for 'H3K27ac'
    -   '*Fox*' may be used as shorthand for 'FOXA1'
    -   '*Ed*' (endogenous) refers to -Dox cells to make it easier to discriminate between -Dox and +Dox
    -   You may need to download some packages, which are included in the '01_packages' file.
